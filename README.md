A tool for creating platformer games.

AN EXTRA NOTE ABOUT THIS FORK:
The "experimental" branch is mainly for myself to have an excuse to create a custom version of Pocket Platformer. If you value your sanity, go to the main GitHub repo that l0bster manages or click on the itch.io link above. If you want to help me customize the engine, by all means, go right ahead and contribute to the "experimental" branch. Either way, it's mainly for me to learn how to program in JavaScript or whatever. üê± <3
